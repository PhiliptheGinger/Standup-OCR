Black Nazi Coworker    15
Now, what do I think about
this guy? Full of shock value, this
guy, too bold for my tatste.

I like my Nazis like I like
my coffee, I don't.

There's already not really a way to
argue w/ someone that far down
the rabbit-hole. I can't really say
this on stage, but I think the
only real way to deal w/ Nazis is
to beat them with a giant mallet
until rendered deceased

Never have I been so in the
right about something, & unable
to fight about it. I love
fighting

I'm scared to do this bit,
right now.

Weirdest high I've ever had. All
it makes me think about is the propaganda
aparatus we're up against.
