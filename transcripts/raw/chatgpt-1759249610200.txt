Elon Musk        7
My neighbor thinks that Elon
Musk is "Real Life Tony Stark"
-Which is a weird thing to hear
outside of the internet

-Normally when you hear something
like that you're just like "Oh,
that's a bot"
-Like I put my
phone down & I'm still talking
to a Russian bot? Wth?


-We can test that theory. Have
a crazy guy kidnap him,. hold
him captive on an island, see
if he builds a mech suit
to escape.
