22     Heard of Hitler?
I'm a really nervous person.
Heard of Hitler?
I sat my white ass down & listened.

I wasn't prepared for this line
of questioning! I'm prepared to get
called racist, & then agree
The last thing I was expecting
ist // win? I won?

"Bla-(!) African American"

I still want to do something about
it,-my friend invited me to a leftist
bookclub.

Which is where we're at as a
country. Like, do you know the
other side has barbeques?
